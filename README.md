Welcome!  Collie is an independent Android messenger built on [Signal](https://signal.org/) and [Molly](https://molly.im/). It uses the Signal network for private messages and calls, with Molly's protections for data stored on your device.  Published application source is inspected here; reconstruction and release engineering live in [collie-release-engineering](https://github.com/0cwa/collie-release-engineering). See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) and [VERIFY.md](VERIFY.md).  [We contribute](https://github.com/mollyim/mollyim-android/pull/852) [back upstream](https://github.com/mollyim/mollyim-android/pull/853).

Collie builds on the work of [Molly](https://github.com/mollyim-android), supporting newer Signal releases, and develops new functionality independently.

## Download

Use the Obtainium link above to stay updated.  Our apk `collie.apk` is on the [Releases page](https://github.com/0cwa/collieim-android/releases)  All APK files in the latest release contain the same Collie app; the older names are available for existing Obtainium filters. All are FOSS and all use the package `im.collie.app` and can be installed alongside Signal or Molly.  *F-droid-compatible repo coming soon.*

_[Throw the dog a bone? 🐶🦴](https://liberapay.com/Collie)_ - It helps me speed up development - I want to work on a desktop client too.

## Features

The releases retain Signal's messaging and calling features and Molly's additions, including:

- Passphrase encryption for the local message database and automatic locking.
- Clearing sensitive data from memory and the option to disable debug logging.
- Linked devices, including Android tablets.
- Blocking messages and calls from unknown contacts.
- Disappearing call history and scheduled local backups.
- Proxy and Tor support.
- WebSocket and UnifiedPush notifications as alternatives to Google's push service.

> [!CAUTION]
> ***If you use Unifiedpush only do so with a server you entrust your entire account and all the metadata of your account.*** (I found, reported, and verified this new major security risk to the Mollysocket developer - more details will be disclosed at a later date.)

## Free and open source

Collie is free and open-source software. Optional FCM notifications use an open-source client and Google's FCM service; WebSocket and [UnifiedPush](https://unifiedpush.org/) are alternatives.

UnifiedPush lets you choose a notification provider. It requires access to a [MollySocket](https://github.com/mollyim/mollysocket) server, *use your own!* **Do not use a public one!** UnifiedPush has never been available on linked devices, [this is a planned Collie feature.](https://github.com/0cwa/collieim-android/issues/21) Android battery restrictions can affect notification delivery.

## Compatibility with Signal

Collie connects to Signal's servers and can communicate with Signal contacts. You can install Collie alongside Signal or Molly.

To use the same Signal account in two apps, one must be linked as a secondary device. Registering the same phone number independently in a second app will disconnect the first. You can also use separate numbers for separate accounts.

Signal's [Terms and Privacy Policy](https://signal.org/legal/) apply when using its service.

## Backups

Collie supports local Signal-format backups. Restoring a backup requires an app version that supports the version of the backup being imported.
